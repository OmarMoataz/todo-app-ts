This project is a todo app implemented with typescript and React and styled-components for styling.

This app relies on a json-server API deployed on https://my-json-server.typicode.com/OmarMoataz/todo-app-ts1.

However, please note that changes are not persisted across calls so if you want to test behavior you'll have to roll your own json-server locally.
